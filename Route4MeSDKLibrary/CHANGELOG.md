### Changed

- In the Utils.cs changed the method [SerializeObjectToJson](https://github.com/route4me/route4me-csharp-sdk/blob/master/Route4MeSDKLibrary/Utils.cs#L89) - for asuring to get correct serialization: if serialization with the DataContractJsonSerializer is failing, serialization with the SerializeObjectToJson will be done.

	1. property [RouteName](https://github.com/route4me/route4me-csharp-sdk/blob/master/Route4MeSDKLibrary/DataTypes/Address.cs#L112) - route name for a depot address.
	2. property [PathToNext](https://github.com/route4me/route4me-csharp-sdk/blob/master/Route4MeSDKLibrary/DataTypes/Address.cs#L454) - array of the path points to a next stop.
- In the AddressBookContact.cs changed type of the properties from object type to:
	1. AddressCube -> double?
	2. AddressPieces -> int?
	3. AddressReferenceNo -> string
	4. AddressRevenue -> double?
	5. AddressWeight -> double?
	6. AddressCustomerPo -> string

- The method [DuplicateRoute](https://github.com/route4me/route4me-csharp-sdk/blob/master/Route4MeSDKLibrary/Route4MeManager.cs#L479) - as the returning parameter response.OptimizationProblemId actually is route_id, now the method returns it as route ID.

    1. added the custom attribute ReadOnlyAttribute to some properties.

- The class [Route](https://github.com/route4me/route4me-csharp-sdk/blob/master/Route4MeSDKLibrary/DataTypes/Route.cs) - added the custom attribute ReadOnlyAttribute to some properties.
- The class [VehicleV4Response](https://github.com/route4me/route4me-csharp-sdk/blob/master/Route4MeSDKLibrary/DataTypes/VehicleV4Response.cs) - all the properties type changed to the string.
